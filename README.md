# Flavours-of-physics

This repository is my first serious attempt to deal with a complete Data Science project from scratch. This exercise originates from Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics). My solution is based on Alexander Garmolin's second ranked solution. However it uses less features, but tests more models (including simple Neural Network). 

Additionaly the Classifier class possesses functions to visualize results of training.
