# Flavours of Physics by Kaggle

This repository is first attempt on dealing with a complete Data Science project from scratch and I gave it an old college try (but it may not be perfect). This exercise originates from Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics). My solution is based on Alexander Garmolin's (https://github.com/gramolin/flavours-of-physics) second ranked solution. However it uses less features, but tests more models (including simple Neural Network). 

Additionaly the Classifier class possesses functions to visualize results of training.
